# Homemade Glider Computer (Work in progress)

A homemade glider computer. Using a GPS and barometric sensor. Computing is made on Raspberry Pi.

**WARNING: PROTOTYPE**

This device is an experimental prototype and should only be used for testing purposes. It is not intended for flight-critical applications or navigation. Use at your own risk. The creator is not responsible for any accidents or damages resulting from its use. Prioritize safety and follow all aviation regulations during testing.

## Installation


**Step 1: Gather the Required Materials**

Before starting the installation process, make sure you have all the necessary materials and components for your homemade glider computer. These may include:

1. Raspberry Pi Zero W (the WiFi model in important for ssh connection for future installations)
2. MicroSD card (at least 32GB)
3. Arduino Micro without headers
4. GPS Module
5. Antenna for the GPS module (not mandatory)
6. Barometric sensor
7. Display (TFT screen 3.5")
8. PiSugar Battery for Raspberry Pi-Zero W/WH 1200 mAh
9. Cables and connectors
10. micro-USB to micro-USB cable
11. Case to mount the components securely (Can be 3D printed).
    You can find the .stl file for the case and the cover on this repository.
(12. Two 2mm screws for closing the case, if 3D printed)

See the [Required Materials](www.google.com) for more informations about all the necessary materials.

**Step 2: Set Up the Raspberry Pi**

For more information. Follow the [***.pdf](www.google.com) for more details. Pages XX to XX

1. Download the latest Raspberry Pi OS Imager from the official website.
2. Flash the OS image onto a microSD. In the Advanced option, enable SSH for remote connection. It is the only way to access to the Pi.
3. Download Advanced IP Scanner from the official website.
4. Download PuTTY - a free SSH and telnet client for Windows. (Or any other SSH solution)
5. Download FileZilla - The free File Transfert Protocol solution. You need this to upload your GPS map to the Pi.
5. Setup the Raspeberry Pi OS . Follow the [***.pdf] guide. Pages XX to XX
6. Insert the microSD card into the Raspberry Pi.


**Step 3: Install Required Software on the Raspberry PI using SSH**

For more information. Follow the [***.pdf](www.google.com) for more details. Pages XX to XX

(This is probably the longest step of the installation)


1. Power up the Raspberry Pi.

2. Scan all the IP's from your network with Advanced IP Scanner so you can the Raspberry Pi's IP address.

3. With the now found IP adress. Connect to your Raspberry Pi through SSH with PuTTY. 

4. Update the Raspberry Pi OS by running:
   ```
   sudo apt-get update
   sudo apt-get upgrade
   ```

5. Clone the git repository by running.
    ```
    git clone https://github.com/Onyme13/Homemade_Glider_Tracker.git
    ```
6. Install Pip and go in to the file and install all needed python libraries by running:
    ```
    sudo apt install python3-pip
    pip --version
    ```

    After installation of pip, you can verify that pip is installed. Then install the needed python libraries:

    ```
    cd Research-Project
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```    

7. File transfert the map zipped file using FileZilla.

8. Unzip the file by running on the Raspberry Pi:
    ```
    sudo apt install unzip
    unzip tile_OSM.zip
    ```
    ...... TO DO 


**Step 4: Set Up the Microcontroller Arduino Micro**

1. Download the Arduino IDE from the official website
2. Connect your microcontroller to your computer with USB
3. Upload the Arduino_Double_Sensor.ino from this repository on the Arduino Micro with the Arduino IDE using your computer.

**Step 5: Assemble the Components**
Carefully solder all the connectors following the schema. Adapt the cabling according to your components.

Follow the [***pdf] steps.

Double-check the schema (wiring diagram) to ensure you have a clear understanding of how the connectors should be soldered. The schema will show the connections between different components, such as sensors, displays, and microcontrollers.

Carefully mount the Raspberry Pi, microcontroller, sensors, display, and other components inside the case. 

**Step 6: Test the Glider Computer Software**

Verify that the software is working as expected. Make sure the data from sensors are accurate, the display shows the relevant information correctly, and the system behaves as intended.

**Step 7: Test the Glider Computer in Flight**

ALWAYS PRIORITIZE THE FLIGHT SAFETY.
KEEP YOUR EYES OUT OF THE PLANE.

Before the actual glider flight, do some ground tests to confirm that the glider computer works as expected. Once you're confident in its functionality, conduct a test flight to see how it performs during actual gliding.

**Step 8: Monitor and Improve**

ALWAYS PRIORITIZE THE FLIGHT SAFETY.
KEEP YOUR EYES OUT OF THE PLANE.

During and after the flight, closely monitor the glider computer's performance. Take note of any issues or improvements that can be made to enhance its functionality or accuracy.

Remember to always prioritize safety and adhere to local regulations.
